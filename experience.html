										<h2>Curation Zone - Data Scientist (1 Year)</h2>
									</header>
									<p>At Curation Zone, I am responsible for developing, maintaining and enhancing the data pipelines which provide the main business logic for the company. I work in a small (5-10 people), dynamic team, delivering a high quality MVP for a recommendation engine.</p>
									<p>My work is focused in Python and SQL. I use the common libraries (Pandas, Numpy, Sklearn) for data processing, along with some distributed tools (Dask, Ray) for larger data sets. I orchestrate the pipeline in Apache Airflow, using Kubernetes for containerization of the pipeline. 
										We make use of AWS services for storage (S3 buckets) and compute resources (EC2 Instances). Our databases make use of MongoDB and Postgres.</p>
									<p>From a Data Science perspective, I run ad-hoc analysis to help inform product development, communicating findings with key stakeholders, including the CTO and CEO. I make use of natural language processing (NLP) tools such as Huggingface (HF) to enhance our datasets, via named-entity recognition and classification tasks. I have made use of HF for training and inference of NLP models for token classification.</p>

										<h2>FTI Consulting - Consultant, Data Science (1 Year)</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
										At FTI Consulting, I worked on several time-sensitive data science projects for both large and small clients. 
										I worked on a large litigation project, where large numbers of scanned documents had to be OCR'ed, cleaned and then various NLP tasks. 
										These included named-entity recognition, token classification and sequence classification tasks.</p>
									<p>
										The tech stack was focused in Python and SQL, using all the common data libraries, as well as Tensorflow for Deep Learning models. These were mainly transformer models, such as XLNet, for NLP tasks.
										I was responsible for training, inference and monitoring of models for the tasks described above. We had to take into account data drift, as well as small quanitites of training data.
									</p>
									<p>
										I also worked on several pro-bono projects, providing data science services through sentiment and topic analysis of social media data to help charities target their own online content.

										<h2>Latymer Upper School - Mathematics Teacher (3 Years)</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
										At Laytmer Upper School, I worked as a Secondary-level Maths teacher. I taught both GCSE and A-Level Mathematics, and Further Mathematics.
										I helped write schemes of work for new qualifications, and provided support for students applying to study Mathematics at univeristy, including Oxford and Cambridge.
									</p>
									<p>
										This has given me excellent presentation skills, and I am well-practised at delivering technical material to a non-technical audience. 
									</p>
									<p>
										I also have around 300 hours of 1-2-1 tutoring experience, where I have offered support to students studying Maths and Maths-related university and school courses.

									<h3>Dunnhumby - Data Science Intern</h3>
									<p>
										At Dunnhumby, I completed a project studying out-of-stock items it a major supermarket chain. 
										Using a poisson model for items being bought, we were able to accurately predict when items were going out of stock. 
										The project was completed in SQL.
